# connect

Connect is a web application for developers and businesses.

It allows businesses to sign up and register projects they would like done (e.g. the creation of a website) and these projects can be placed on the marketplace where developers who are signed up on the site can view and then make requests to join the project. Once developers have been accepted for a project and the project has been started, Connect provided a platform that guides the project through a product lifecycle, providing a message board for communication between all parties and a system to 
ensure that all parties are ready to move on to the next stage of the products lifecycle when moving 
forward.
